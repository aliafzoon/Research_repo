# Denoising Auto-Encoder 

This repository contains Tensorflow implementation of the following paper: ***
We use an auto-encoder to denoise the phase values of a 14 bus power system.


This repo contains to IPython notebooks. 
## Installing Prerequisites

To use these files prpoperly, you need to install a Jupuyer notebook or
Jupyter lab.
```bash
  pip install jupyterlab
```

To install the extra packages:
```bash
  pip install numpy pandas pathlib tensorflow  
```

## Usage

The file modelv1.2.ipynb is used to train the model and
 Result_check.ipynb is used to make predictions and calculate
 MSE and MAE. 
You can get the trained weights alongside with the dataset upon reasonable request
through aliafzoon@gmail.com.

After setting the correct path for the data and save folder, 
everything is ready to go.
